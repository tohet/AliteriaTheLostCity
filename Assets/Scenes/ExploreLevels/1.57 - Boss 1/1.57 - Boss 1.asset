  - '[HINIE] Dude! Check it out, it''s a beacon!'
  - '[HINIE] Oh, yeah, I need to explain that, too. You see, Aridian desert is very
    hard to navigate, since it''s mostly just sand and couple of tiny villages here
    and there. Ancient alterians came up with a very interesting solution. There are
    many buildings like this one. Convoluted systems of light power crystals and mirrors
    are used to create a giant thick beam of light that reaches the nearest big city.
    And that would be Kaur, our destination.'
  - '[HINIE] Well, I think we''ve going a bit off-track for the last couple of days.
    I''m not sure, though. This bad boy right here will help us to find the shortest
    way to the city of Kaur, our destination. '
  - '[HINIE] Hope I''ve got to rememeber something useful out of these scrolls I''ve
    read about the beacons. Let''s go activate this thing!'
