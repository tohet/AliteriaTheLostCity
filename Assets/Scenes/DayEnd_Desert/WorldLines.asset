  - /UREACHABLE LINE/
  - '[HINIE] World is a damn big thing. What part of it do you wanna talk about?'
  - '[HINIE] Ah, these little guys. What do you want to know about them? '
  - '[HINIE] Ballcrabs look kinda clumsy, but they''re surprisingly fast [4 AP]. And
    these little claws chop fast [2 AP for each attack, 20 DMG per attack]. Usually
    it takes two good hits to put a crab down [100 HP].'
  - '[HINIE] Basically, you don''t want to just stand in front of one ad let it hit
    you. And Alia forbid you from getting mauled by a bunch of them. Just run away,
    if things get dicey.'
  - '[HINIE] They are the desert''s most numerous inhabitants. Ballcrabs can dig themselves
    deep into the sand, so they can hide from big predators. They''re omnivorous,
    eating everything that comes around.'
  - '[HINIE] These guys usuallly travel in flocks. They hide in their shells and just
    roll down the dunes. It''s pretty funny when you get to see it. Just a bunch of
    balls rolling around. '
  - '[HINIE] Demons.'
  - '[HINIE] Yeah, sure. So, basically, you and I were created by our father who stole
    a bunch of souls from dead people. He put those souls into scarecrows and turned
    them into living things. Us. '
  - '[HINIE] Yeah, I know. It''s kinda difficult to grasp at first. But you''ll get
    used to it. Just remember: dad''s name is Navius. So we''re all Navians. There
    are many of our brothers and sisters out there.'
  - '[HINIE] It''s good you''ve brought it up. You can never find potions on corpses.
    That''s because people who have them usually just don''t die.'
  - '[HINIE] Well, you can''t use a potion if it''s deep inside of your pocket. You
    need to keep it close in case you need to drink it quick.

    [Open Inventory and put a potion in an empty Use Slot, then press Use]'
  - '[HINIE] The most common are red alcohol bottles, use them to heal [Heal 30 HP].
    There are also yellow potions, these give you a lot of energy [+2 AP]. Blue potions
    help you stand some heavy punches [+30 DEF]. '
  - '[HINIE] Oh yeah, also. If we''re not in battle and you decide to drink a potion,
    I''ll drink half of the bottle taking half of potion''s effects. It''s a common
    rule to share all the food and drinks while traveling through desert. '
  - '[HINIE] I''m not the one who came up with it. The rule came from some groups
    of navians who got in and out of Aridian desert. Everyone of these guys told us
    that you always gotta share everything if you want to survive. Some other grops
    tried to avoid this rule. But they didn''t come back from the desert...'
  - '[HINIE] Oh yeah. Armor is quite a scarce thing out here in the wasteland. You
    should also be wondering why I''m taking all the helmets and boots we find...'
  - '[HINIE] So, it''s a bit easier to explain with the helmets. Since you''re a hornfeld
    you have four boney spikes sticking out of your skull. They look cool, but it''s
    a huge pain in the ass to find you fitting headgear. Most helmets that we find
    are not hornfeld-adapted, so it''s me who takes them. '
  - '[HINIE] I, on the other hand, cannot wear any of these chestplates that we find.
    There''s pretty much nothing of that sort that wouldn''t break my wings. So chestplates
    are all yours. '
  - "[HINIE] As for the boots, I'm pretty much dead as soon as some jerk grabs me
    by a leg. Like, I can't even fly away at this point. So yeah, I'll have the boots.
    \nAnd since you can deal with more upper body damage, you get the gloves so you
    can defend yourself better. Hope it all makes sense."
  - '[HINIE] Apart from just making you a little harder to kill [+DEF], armor found
    in desert also deals with the intense heat of this place. I believe it''s the
    fabric that reflects it somehow. Anyway, it allows for a little more comfort of
    movement [+AP].'
  - '[HINIE] That''s one sad topic. Humans used to rule over this entire world. They
    created a lot of usefull stuff like tools, armor and weapons. All the buildings
    that we stuble upon also were created by humans. There were other things like
    religion, science...

    Anyway, humans are mostly gone by now, it''s only us navians. '
  - '[HINIE] If you pass by a human''s courpse, there''s always a good chance that
    it will just stand up and attack you. Some of our psychics have actually detected
    metnal activity in these dead guys and gals. So, that must mean that they''re
    not so dead after all. '
  - '[HINIE] Nobody really knows. At some point all of them were just gone. Like,
    there''s absolutely no explanations in any of those ancient texts that we''ve
    found. A whole civilization just gone in an instant.

    Some of our brothers pointed out that there are a lot of burn marks on all of
    humans'' buildings. But there''s nothing more than that at this point. '
  - '[HINIE] Yeah. Take it any way you want. The point is, if it wasn''t for all the
    looting, we would''ve been dead by now. '
  - '[HINIE] I''m glad you want to talk about it. I don''t really know how our mind
    works, but I''m not sure if you''re supposed to gain character traits everyday
    like you do...'
  - '[HINIE] Well, you see different sides of this world and form your relationships
    with them. You see how me and your other siblings act, and you choose to act the
    same or in a completely different way. I guess, that''s how it works. '
  - '[HINIE] If you find out that you are an asshole and tell me about this, and the
    next day you say the same exact thing, nothing really changes, as far as I know.

    [Mentals and their effects don''t stack]'
  - '[HINIE] Oh, you''d like to discuss some of them daddy issues, eh? No worries,
    dude, we''ve all got them one way or another. So, what do you wanna know adout
    the Big Man? '
  - '[HINIE] As far as I know, he''s an alien who came from space some time ago. He
    tried to rule over this world but found out that he''s not strong enough for this.
    Eventually he just decided to create a bunch of us navians to enliven this deserted
    planet.

    He''s basically just a walking corpse, but he''s still extremely strong. '
  - '[HINIE] He walks around the world creating us navians by mixing pure soul energy
    with some shit and sticks. Some of our brothers once told me that he can also
    somehow revive you using only your remains. I''m not to eager to see if it''s
    true or not. '
  - '[HINIE] Yeah, happened to me once. It was like 30 years ago, I guess. He seemed
    to be quite a chill dude to me. I remember myself complaining to him about how
    I was abused by the people at my campsite. He told me to leave them back then.
    Well, took me some time to take his advice.'
  - '[HINIE] Ooh, I like this topic. There are lots of good texts written about the
    great Trio.

    Who do you wanna know about? Alia the Almighty, Terus the Destroyer or Gartek
    the Wise?'
  - '[HINIE] Alia is the highest deity of our world. She rules over all the matter,
    she is all the matter, to be more precise. The temperature of her body is beyond
    our comprehension, it''s purest energy. The hottest lady around here, yeah. As
    parts of her body cool down, they become gases, fluids and solid materials that
    make up us and all around us. Alia''s holy shape is triangle. Her color is blue.'
  - '[HINIE] Terus is the deity of all living creatures. He is one aressive bastard,
    since life itself is a constant fight against the world, according to some ancient
    texts. Terus is all about blood, sex, war and other things of that nature. He''s
    cultists are all weirdos, I think. Terus'' holy shape is rhombus. His color is
    red.'
  - '[HINIE] Gartek is the deity of mind. He''s the highest patron of all scientists
    and medics. He''s a bit of a trickster, too. There are a lot of fairy tales including
    him as a guy who always makes fun of all the ignorant jerks. Ancient aliterians
    used to love him a lot. I guess, he misses those times the most... Gartek''s holy
    shape is circle. His color is green.'
  - '[HINIE] Body-ge... Uh, don''t get me wrong, it''s a cool word, that you came
    up with. But let''s keep it simple for now, okay? Body types. Or body shapes,
    if you wish.

    Navians and humans come in four total: ants, dragonflies, scarabs and hornfelds.'
  - "[HINIE] Well, first, there are ants. These guys are the most basic ones out there.
    Normal height, normal weight, just a bit of muscles here and there. Their skin
    is usually flat gray, but it can get to some very exotic colors.\nNext there are
    dragonflies. These guys are super thin with very long limbs. Their skin usually
    has very pronounced green or yellow tones.\nScarabs are the big guys. The biggest
    of 'em all. With thick bodies, thick and short limbs. Their skin is quite dark.
    \nHornfelds... Well, they're ants, but with horns. The most vividly colored guys
    on the whole Aliteria, though."
  - '[HINIE] On your head you have four good reasons for me to tell you that you''re
    a hornfeld. You''re pretty thin though. I don''t know if it''s because you''re
    partially a dragonfly or because you barely get anything to eat.

    As for myself I like to think that I''m a dragonfly, but my stupid brothers back
    at the campsite used every opportunity to tell me that I''m too fat to be one.
    But I am, anyway.'
